# Common Alerting Procotol (CAP) Parser

## CAP (De)Parser



## What is CAP ?

> *The Common Alerting Protocol (CAP), a digital format for exchanging emergency alerts, allows a consistent alert message to be disseminated simultaneously over multiple communications pathways.*
>
> In *www.fema.gov*

Simply putting, CAP is XML message-formatted based communication focussed one structuring the main aspects of any given emergency in a easy to read / easy to exchange message.
This messages can then be used for communication between devices and for long-term storage in XML files.

It was developed by **Oasis Open**, and full specifications can be found [here](https://docs.oasis-open.org/emergency/cap/v1.2/CAP-v1.2.html).

*An [example](#example) of a CAP message can be seen bellow*

- Geographically target emergency alerts to a defined warning area. This is limited only by the capacity of the delivery system used.
- Serve the needs of people who are deaf, hard of hearing, blind or low vision.
- Send alerts in multiple languages.
